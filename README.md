# Java OOP Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple Java programs developed while learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each project focuses on practicing concepts like classes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation,
and modular code design.

## 📁 Projects Included

- GuessGame.java` – A number guessing game.
- OnlineLibrary.java` – A basic library management system (add/issue/return books).
- RockPaperScissor.java` – A console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

## 🧠 Purpose

These projects were created as part of my practice to strengthen core Java skills through hands-on implementation. They serve as learning experiments and can be helpful for others starting out with OOP in Java.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the projects locally:

1. Clone the repository: in bash / IDE terminal

- git clone https://github.com/Swarna-deep0/Java-oop-practice.git
